# Introduction to Bayesian Regression

In the previous chapter, we introduced Bayesian decision making using posterior probabilities and a variety of loss functions. We discussed how to minimize the expected loss for hypothesis testing. Moreover, we introduced the concept of Bayes factors and gave some examples on how Bayes factors can be used in Bayesian hypothesis testing for comparison of two means. We also discussed how to choose appropriate and robust priors. When there is no conjugacy, we applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the posterior distributions of parameters of interest. 

In this chapter, we will apply Bayesian inference methods to linear regression. We will first apply Bayesian statistics to simple linear regression models, then generalize the results to multiple linear regression models. We will see when using the reference prior, the posterior means, posterior standard deviations, and credible intervals of the coefficients coincide with the counterparts in the frequentist ordinary least square (OLS) linear regression models. However, using the Bayesian framework, we can now interpret credible intervals as the probabilities of the coefficients lying in such intervals.
